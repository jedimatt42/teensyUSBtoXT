teensyUSBtoXT
=============

Simple Arduino based USB to XT keyboard converter.

### None of this is tested yet!

I am targeting my:
  Myarc Geneve 9640 Family Computer.

The XT keyboard write routine was taken from 'tinyPS2toXTArduino'

This will be built using the same hardware as my TI 99 USB Keys 
adapter. (just output to a XT 5pin DIN instead of simulating the 
TI-99/4a matrix keyboard)

See [XT Scan Codes](http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/scan.htm) for encoding details.
